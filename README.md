**Netflix_Data_Cleaning_SQL**

Welcome to the Netflix dataset for data cleaning and visualization project. 
This dataset is a cleaned version of the original Netflix dataset, which can be accessed from this link. 
It includes movies, TV shows, and original content added to Netflix from 2008 to 2021, ranging from the oldest content in 1925 to the latest in 2021.
Our aim is to demonstrate our data cleaning and visualization skills using PostgreSQL and Tableau, respectively.

To start with, we will perform the following steps on the dataset:

Handle null values
Remove duplicates
Populate missing rows
Discard irrelevant columns
Split columns

Further details and additional information regarding the process will be provided in the code comments. 
You can access the cleaned dataset here and the Tableau dashboard here.
